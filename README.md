# COVID-SES-race
This repository describes a project in which I attempt to compare the value of socioeconomic status (SES) and racial/ethnic composition as predictors of COVID-19 prevalence and death rates. Below, I will list the sources I will be using as well as the most recent year for which that source provides data.

Poverty data source (2018): https://www.ers.usda.gov/webdocs/DataFiles/82701/RuralAtlasData22.xlsx?v=9553.2 (link to download Excel file)
Race/ethnicity data source (2019): https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/datasets/2010-2019/counties/asrh/cc-est2019-alldata.csv
COVID-19 data source (2020): https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data/blob/master/us-counties.csv
